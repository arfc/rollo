================================================
Reactor evOLutionary aLgorithm Optimizer
================================================

**ROLLO** is an open-source Python package that applies evolutionary algorithm 
techniques to optimize nuclear reactor design.  
It couples the `DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) 
<https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_ evolutionary algorithm driver with 
nuclear software, such as neutron transport and thermal-hydraulics codes.
**ROLLO** is nuclear-software agnostic, and designed to easily couple to any software. 

**ROLLO**'s source code is hosted on `Github 
<https://github.com/arfc/rollo/>`_.
For more information on ROLLO, feel free to post a message on the
`ROLLO Github Discussions Forum <https://github.com/arfc/rollo/discussions/>`_.
