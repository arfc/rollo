================================================
Reactor evOLutionary aLgorithm Optimizer
================================================

**ROLLO** is an open-source Python package that applies evolutionary algorithm 
techniques to optimize nuclear reactor design. 
It essentially couples the `DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) 
<https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_ evolutionary algorithm driver with 
nuclear software.
**ROLLO** is nuclear-software agnostic, and designed to easily couple to any software. 

**ROLLO** is developed by members of the `Advanced Reactor and Fuel Cycles Group 
<http://arfc.github.io/>`_ at the `University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 
<https://illinois.edu/>`_.
