ROLLO (Reactor evOLutionary aLgorithm Optimizer)
================================================

**ROLLO** is an open-source Python package that applies evolutionary algorithm 
techniques to optimize nuclear reactor design. 
It essentially couples an evolutionary algorithm driver with nuclear software.

**ROLLO** relies on the evolutionary algorithm driver, `DEAP (Distributed 
Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) <https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_.
**ROLLO** is nuclear-software agnostic, and can be easily coupled to any software. 

**ROLLO** is developed by members of the `Advanced Reactor and Fuel Cycles Group 
<http://arfc.github.io/>`_ at the `University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign 
<https://illinois.edu/>`_.
