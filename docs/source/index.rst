ROLLO (Reactor evOLutionary aLgorithm Optimizer)
================================================

**ROLLO** is a Python package that applies evolutionary algorithm techniques to 
optimize nuclear reactor design. 
It essentially couples an evolutionary algorithm driver with nuclear software.

**ROLLO** relies on the evolutionary algorithm driver, `DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) <https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_.
**ROLLO** is currently enabled to work with the following nuclear software: 

1) `OpenMC <https://openmc.org/>`_ 

2) `Moltres <https://github.com/arfc/moltres/>`_.

**ROLLO** is developed by members of the `Advanced Reactor and Fuel Cycles Group <http://arfc.github.io/>`_ at the `University of Illinois at Urbana=Champaign <https://illinois.edu/>`_.
