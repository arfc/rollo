This study presents the need and effectiveness of adopting deep learning for generative design (or design exploration) research area. This work proposes an artificial intelligent (AI)-based deep generative design framework that is capable of generating numerous design options which are not only aesthetic but also optimized for engineering performance. The proposed framework integrates topology optimization and generative models (e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs)) in an iterative manner to explore new design options, thus generating a large number of designs starting from limited previous design data. In addition, anomaly detection can evaluate the novelty of generated designs, thus helping designers choose among design options. The 2D wheel design problem is applied as a case study for validation of the proposed framework. The framework manifests better aesthetics, diversity, and robustness of generated designs than previous generative design methods.},

The computer now becomes a design generator in addition to its more conventional role as draftsperson, visualizor, data checker and performance analyst. Motivated by the challenge to enable designers to easily develop meaningful input models of design intent to make best use of a structural generative method, this paper describes an initial combination of a generative design tool, eifForm, and an associative modeling system, Custom Objects, through the use of XML models. The current combined use is illustrated through an example involving generation of a set of 20 interrelated roof trusses with seven unique spans initiated by a parametric model of a saddle shaped stadium roof in Custom Objects. The paper concludes with a discussion of the synergies between associative modeling and generative systems and identifies future extensions aimed to exploit these synergies towards integrated performance-based generative design tools.},

	abstract = {A generative CAD based design exploration method is proposed. It is suitable for complex multicriteria design problems where important performance criteria are uncomputable. The method is based on building a genotype of the design within a history based parametric CAD system and then, varying its parameters randomly within pre-defined limits to generate a set of distinctive designs. The generated designs are then filtered through various constraint envelopes representing geometric viability, manufacturability, cost and other performance related constraints, thus reducing the vast design space into a smaller viable design space represented by a set of distinctive designs. These designs may then be further developed by the designer. The proposed generative design method makes minimal imposition on the designer’s work process and maintains both flexibility and fluidity that is required for creative design exploration. Its ability to work seamlessly with current CAD based design practices from early conceptual to detailed design is demonstrated. The design philosophy behind this generative method and the key steps involved in its implementation are presented with examples.},

Such systems make the computer a generative design tool and are already used extensively as a rapid prototyping technique in architecture and aeronautics. Combining a design generation tool with an analysis software and an evolutionary algorithm provides a methodology for optimising designs. This work combines NASA's parametric aircraft design tool (OpenVSP) with a ﬂuid dynamics solver (OpenFOAM) to create and analyse aircraft. An evolutionary algorithm is then used to generate a range of aircraft that maximise lift and reduce drag while remaining within the framework of the original design. Our approach allows the designer to automatically optimise their chosen design and to generate models with improved aerodynamic efﬁciency. Different components on three aircraft models are varied to highlight the ease and effectiveness of the parametric model optimisation.},
